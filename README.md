flycheck-kotlin
===============

This library provides a [flycheck][] checker for [Kotlin] files.

Installation
------------

You'll need Emacs 24 for `flycheck`, so the recommended way to get
`flycheck-kotlin` is as a package from the [MELPA][melpa]
repository. The version of `flycheck-kotlin` there will always be
up-to-date.

If you insist on doing things the hard way, first ensure `flycheck` is
installed, then download this code and add the directory to your Emacs
`load-path`.

Then, in your `init.el`:

```lisp
(eval-after-load 'flycheck
  '(progn
    (require 'flycheck-kotlin)
    (flycheck-kotlin-setup)))
```

Make sure that the `ktlint` binary is present on Emacs' `exec-path`.
See [ktlint site](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint) for details.


Usage
-----

When `flycheck` is enabled (e.g. with `global-flycheck-mode`), `kotlin-mode`
buffers will be automatically checked using this checker.
